Inspired by a neutralogical phenomenon called synesthesia, I want to create an interactive installation that 
utilizes color in direct relation to a given sound. Synesthesia is defined as the production of a sense impression 
relating to one sense or part of the body by stimulation of another sense or part of the bodyâ€“in other words it's
having multiple expierences while recieving one piece of information. Focusing specifically on the expierence 
of "seeing" sound, I'm interested in how sound can influence creation.

The installation will be programmed to take the nearby sound and give it form based on volume, and time. Each 
hour will be given a designated color, while the volume of nearby sound determines the brightness of that color. 
With respects to these variables, each second of sound will be recorded as a 10 pixel by 10 pixel block.

Grid formation: (59 seconds by 59 minutes) = 590x590
Second: 1 block = 10x10 | Minute: 59 blocks = 590x10 | Hour: 3481 blocks = 590x590 

The end of each hour should result in an abstract gridded structure constructed solely out of the color of sound.

I enjoy the idea of being able to compare and contrast volumes based on the hours of the day and location, and
all through a simple grid structure.
